# NOTE: The noise approximation below is a poor approximation of drift,
#       since it doesn't simulate distortion within the submaps themselves.
#       Only use it for quick tests. For proper validation, use the
#       mapper_test_bench which builds the submaps online based on simulated
#       noisy odometry.
